Contact Tracing - Croatia

![](apkicon_HR.png)

**Stop Covid19** is the official app - provided by the Croatian Ministry of Health.

It's based on the decentralized contact/proximity BLE tracing of Apple+Google Exposure Notifications API.

Since build 2.1.0 the app also supports cross-border data exchange between the Croatian Stop COVID-19 application and official applications from other EU member states. Users have to manually enable the sharing of the keys with the EU key-exchange gateway = it's disabled by default.
